            <div>Carnival Horizon – which set sail in April 2018 –  is one of the fleet's newer ships. 
                It accommodates 1,450 crew members and a maximum of 5,101 passengers,
                 and it offers a plethora of amenities for travelers of all ages. 
                 Children can ride the SkyRide suspended bike, play at the Dr. Seuss-themed water park and 
                 climb the ropes course, while parents can lounge on an adults-only deck and pamper 
                 themselves at the Cloud 9 Spa. At night, the whole family can enjoy 
                live performances and lip-syncing competitions.</div>
